# Renpy-s-lockpick-minigame
A lockpick minigame from renpy 

This is a lockpick minigame i rebuild myself because the original one: https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=58049 was laggy, pick position was weird when i move my mouse and the file contain some redundant code. So i just fix the formular and change the code my way. But because config.overlay_screen("inventory_icon") wasn't work for me so the screen code might be a bit clumsy with hiding and showing stuff, but i think you can fix that yourself.

The lisence and every properties like audio and image belongs to the person in the link above, i got nothing to do with that.

Ping me on Zeil Learning discord server if you need help with understanding the code.
