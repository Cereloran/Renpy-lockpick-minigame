# Renpy-lockpick-minigame
A lockpick minigame from renpy 

This is a lockpick minigame i rebuild myself because the original one: https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=58049 was laggy, pick position was weird when i move my mouse and the file contain some redundant code. So i just fix the formular and change the code my way. 

Because config.overlay_screen("inventory_icon") wasn't work for me so the screen code might be a bit clumsy with hiding and showing stuff, but i think you can fix that yourself. The key feature hasn't done yet and the inventory is just a list right now so i'll update this minigame in the future

The lisence and every properties like audios and images belongs to the person in the link above, i got nothing to do with that.

Ping me on Zeil Learning discord server if you need help with understanding the code. This is my first time to public my github repository so sorry if it look clumsy
