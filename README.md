# Renpy-lockpick-minigame
## A lockpick minigame made by Renpy

## By Rice Studio üçô From VietNam

The original idea is from https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=58049 but it was laggy, the pick position doesn't match with the mouse postion and they used many redundant lines of code in it so i decided to fix it up a bit, changing the formular and some conditions.

The lisence and every properties like audios and images belongs to the person in the link above, i got nothing to do with that.

Because config.overlay_screen.append("inventory_icon") wasn't work for me so the screen code might be a bit clumsy with hiding and showing stuff, but i think you can fix that yourself. The key feature hasn't done yet and the inventory is just a list right now so i'll update this minigame in the future. (Also right now you might have a rare chance to meet an error saying float division by zero when your mouse is in the exact middle of the screen, imma fix that later)

Ping me on Zeil Learning discord server if you need help with understanding the code. This is my first time to public my github repository so sorry if it look messy.
