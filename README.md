### About the Minigame
The original idea is from https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=58049 but it was laggy, the pick position doesn't match with the mouse postion and they used many redundant lines of code in it so i decided to fix it up a bit, changing the formular and some conditions. (They still rock, i just fix the buggy thing)

The lisence and every properties like audios and images belongs to the person in the link above, i got nothing to do with that.

### Dev note
Because `config.overlay_screen.append("inventory_icon")` wasn't work for me so the screen code might be a bit clumsy with hiding and showing stuff, but i think you can fix that yourself. The key feature isn't being used and the inventory is just a list right now but i think it'll gonna be fun for you to make it yourself, beside, different people make different type of inventory class so i won't make one.

Ping me on [Zeil Learning discord server](https://discord.gg/BNEMkv3W) if you need help with understanding the code. This is my first time to public my github repository so sorry if it look messy.

### How to download
Find the only green button here and click on download zip, or you can open the `script.rpy` file and download audio and images separately

Copy the code to your `script.rpy` file, if you want it to be in another file, make sure you change `init python` to `init -1 python`. This will set the order of the minigame to go first

Place the images in the `images` folder and the audios to the `audio` folder
